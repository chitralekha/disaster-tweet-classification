# disaster-tweet-classification
Deep learning project for classifying tweets as disaster-related or not using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Built using Keras with Bidirectional LSTM, trained on Kaggleâ€™s disaster tweets dataset. Includes preprocessing, model tuning, evaluation, and Kaggle leaderboard submission.
## Project Overview

This project applies natural language processing and deep learning to classify tweets as related to real disasters or not. The model uses a Bidirectional LSTM architecture with Keras, trained on the Kaggle "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" dataset.

Key components include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Tokenization and padding
- Word embedding via Keras Embedding layer
- Bidirectional LSTM-based sequential model
- Hyperparameter tuning and early stopping
- Submission to Kaggle for evaluation

A final submission was made with a public leaderboard score of **0.74256**.
